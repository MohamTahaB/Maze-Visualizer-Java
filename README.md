## General Information
- Maze visualizer ;
- Highlights the shortest path from a start point to a finish point ;
- The moves are all equally weighted.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Technologies Used
- Java ;
- GUI was made using SWING.


## Features

- Enables uploading an already existing maze, as long as it is ###SQUARE, in a .txt file where : 
    * "D" is the start node ;
    * "A" is the finish node ;
    * "E" is a node where it is possible to pass ;
    * "W" stands for wall .
- Walls can be added or discarded by clicking on the concerned node ;
- Enables saving the maze under the name "Backup.txt" with the possibility of choosing the directory.


## Setup
Setup is fairly simple : upload the classes in src folder, there is a maze sample in Data folder as well to get started, and run MainTest.


## Uncertainties
The project was made on a Mac, which posed some different results reguarding the GUI, especially Colorchanging the maze grid to highlight the optimal path.
